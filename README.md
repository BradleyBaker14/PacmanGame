# PacmanGame
This application was all writing in C#

This a redesign of the pacman game. The basic pacman game has pacman and 4 ghosts, where pacman eats small pills and 4 large bills.
With this redesign the conecpt is the same where the main character eats small pills, however the main character is a dog called Rex that is trying to catch chickens. However the chickens are holiding chicken 
drum sticks that can "bonk" Rex.

Please ensure that you have at least Visual Studio 2022 version intalled so that the application can be run.
